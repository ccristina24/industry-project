üìÑ Overview 

Based on the page that I designed in Figma - Threads, I decided to code a part of it to improve my coding skills.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

HTML5
Tailwind CSS (v3.4.1)  
JavaScript
Figma 
Copilot (AI)
Git & GitHub  


‚úÖ Features

- Custom Tailwind config: Uses our own colors and fonts.
- Topic selection: Clickable topic buttons with a highlight (dark border) for the selected topic.
- Post input: Textarea for users to write a message/post
- Post button: Posts the message when clicked.
- Dynamic post display: Each post appears in a new styled container below, showing the message and the selected topic.
- Multiple posts: Users can submit multiple posts, each displayed in its own container.

üß† Technical Notes

- Tailwind utility classes were used to speed up styling and maintain consistency
- Git is used for version control ‚Äî improvements ongoing
- Copilot was used to help me with js, as I am not that experienced with it
